# Cellular Automata Modeling Vaccine Hesitancy
### Jayce Slesar & Carter Ward
### code located in assignment_2 directory

# Overview
## Interactions:
## Interaction & Turnover Rate / Prob of Change
Hesitant --> Unsure      |   alpha = ()  \
Unsure --> Not Hesitant  |   beta  =  ()  \
Not Hesitant --> Unsure  |   gamma =  ()  \
Unsure --> Hesitant      |   rho   =  ()

## Mechanisms:
Open-Mindedness --> initialized randomly on group change depending on group you are in

## In Order to Change:
Look at neighbors....

Sum of influence in neighborhood will result in a change between groups/states or no change. Must overcome the open-mindedness constant

Unsure person won't change mind of someone else
